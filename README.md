# Web Components jamboree

This repository contains some examples of Web Components using native web APIs without any library on top like Stencil or LitElement.

It was used to showcase Web Components basic capabilities during a quick presentation I did at [Shippio](https://www.shippio.io/)

The Web Components examples are used in a Svelte starter project to show that they are compatible with most front-end frameworks.

## Local setup

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
